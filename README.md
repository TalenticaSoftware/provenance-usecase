# Provenance

Objective of this project is to keep track of Champagne Bottles from creation stage to their sale to the end customer.

Every bottle has a unique ID that can be used to track. Multiple bottles are grouped as a shipment order and assigned to carrier. This shipment is delivered to shop owner, carrier notifies the delivery completion and bottles are assigned to the delivered shop owner. As a last step bottle is sold to customer.
